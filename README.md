# coder13.github.io

This is my personal portfolio / blog website.

It's built with jekyll and has dynamic content powered by vuejs

The vue code in `main.js` fetches from github to autofill project data and update the stars, language, and description on my repos so far. My plan is to hopefully automate the entirety of it so that I only need to update a description in one place for example.

## Installing

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Running

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
