=================

My Resume webpage.

Most recently rewritten with jekyll.

Now powered with Vue.JS! My vue backend polls from github to autofill data and update the stars on my repos so far. My plan is to hopefully automate the entirety of it so that I only need to update a description in one place for example.

I also have a few other personal pages here. The plan is to flesh this out into possibly a blog site / personal website.
