## Past

I started writing code in 2010 with a litle bit of html and visual basic. As a 13 year old, I got hooked on writing .NET software such as web browsers. I then "graduated" to C# where I got more of a famliarity writing C-like code doing much the same software.

I eventually found java and lwjgl where I started messing around with making a [java game engine](https://github.com/coder13/VEngine) eventually making a small [minecraft clone](https://github.com/coder13/Warrios)

Come 2014, I began learning web development where I fell in love with the platform and it's ease to develop on. From the start, I started learning NodeJS and serving little html and vanilla javascript websites.

My first major full stack project was [Fantasy Cubing 2017](https://github.com/coder13/fantasycubing). Users could pick teams of rubik's cube solvers attending competitions each week to win points based on how well their team did. 

A couple years later, covid would help me find the time to develop and release my biggest website yet, [Letscube](https://github.com/coder13/letscube). I filled a gap in the rubik's cube software world with a proper webapp that lets users compete against each other in real time. 

## Present

I'm currently focusing on joining the work force by finishing up school and applying for jobs while writing code here and there.
