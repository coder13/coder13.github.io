## Hi
I'm Caleb Hoover. I make websites, music, and dj occasionally. I also volunteer running [rubik's cube](https://worldcubeassociation.org) competitions.

You might know me for [letscube.net](https://letscube.net), a webapp that allows users to compete against eachother solving rubik's cubes. I also made [WCARegs](https://wcaregs.netlify.app/). In addition, I have many, many more projects on my [github](https://github.com/coder13).

I sometimes make music over on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/calode) and dj on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/klebh).
