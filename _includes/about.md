## Hi

I'm Cailyn Hoover. I make websites and run [WCA sanctioned rubik's cube](https://worldcubeassociation.org) competitions.

You might know me for [letscube.net](https://letscube.net), a webapp that allows users to compete against each other solving rubik's cubes. I also made [WCARegs](https://wcaregs.netlify.app/).

Most recently, I have spent a large amount of time specializing in groups communication software for WCA competitions. I have 2 popular websites:

- [competitiongroups.com](https://competitionGroups.com) has been used by tens of thousands of people to communicate groups
- [delegate-dashboard](https://delegate-dashboard.netlify.app/) has been used by competition organizers all over the world to generate groups

In addition to these, I have many, many more projects on my [github](https://github.com/coder13).
